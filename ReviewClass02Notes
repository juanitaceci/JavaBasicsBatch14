	Type Casting:
	Type casting is converting the type of data from one data type to another. We have 2 types of Type Casting.

	1) Explicit/Narrowing/Manual  2) Implicit/Widening/Automatic

	When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one it is called explicit/narrowing/Manual and when we go from a smaller data type
	to a larger data type we call it Implicit/widening/Automatic.

  Amount of Bytes in these Data Types:
	byte(8) 
	short(16) 
	char(16) 
	int(32) 
	long(64)
	float(32) 
	Double(64)
	
	Implicit/Widening/Automatic
	byte-->short-->char-->int-->long-->float-->Double
	
	Explicit/narrowing/Manual
	byte-<-short<--char<--int<--long<--float<--Double
	
	Why we need type casting?
	When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different data types.
	WHen we are working with math sometimes we need to get rid of decimal part as we are only intrested in the non-decimal part.
	
	What is the Syntax?
	
	Explicit/narrowing/manual
	int box=1000;
	byte box2=(byte) box;
	
	Implicit/Widening/Automatic
	short box1=250;
	int box2=box1;
	===========================================================================================
	if Statements:
		if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decisions based 
		on some condition and provided data.
		-if condition
		-if else condition
		-if else if condition
		-nested if else condition
		
		Why we should learn about if else condition?
		Like testing a website our program needs to make a lot of decisions.
		
	What is the syntax of if else conditions?
	-if condition	
	
	boolean rich=true;
	if(rich){
	System.out.println("start writing as many codes inside the brackets");
	}
