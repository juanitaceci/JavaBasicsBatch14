      Loops in Java:
  1. While
  2. Do While
  3. For Loop
  4. For Each Loop
  5. Enhanced For Loop
  
  When do we use:
  --> For Loop: When we know number of repetitions/Iterations in advanced
  for(Initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
    Code repeat;
    }
    
    While Loop & Do While Loop: When we don't know the number of repetitions
    
    While vs. Do While
    
   --> While checks condition first--> Then executes codes
    while(boolean condition){
    code to repeat;
    }
    
   --> Do While executes codes--> Then checks condition
   do{
   code to repeat;
   }while(boolean condition);
   
   Break Keyword:
    The Java break is used to break loop or switch statement. It breaks the 
    current flow of the program at specified condition. In case of inner loop, it 
    breaks only inner loop.
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
    				   ----->//This is where you do not want to place a break; or code will stop
     if (i == 4) {
     break;           ----> //Break will stop loop So it is best to use inside an If and not For Loop begining.
     }
     System.out.println(i);
      } 
   
   Continue Keyword:
    The Java continue keyword can be used in any of the loop control structures. 
    It causes the loop to immediately jump to the next iteration of the loop.
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
     if (i == 4) {
     continue;
     }
    System.out.println(i);
     }
     
    Another Example how to use Continue:
     // I want to print numbers from 1 to 20 except number 3, 7 and 11
			for (int i=1; i<=20; i++) {
			if(i==3 || i==7 || i==11) {
			continue;
			}
			System.out.print(i+" ");
			}
